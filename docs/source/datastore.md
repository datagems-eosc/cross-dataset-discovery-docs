# Datastores

The Cross-Dataset Discovery service relies on a Vector Database for fast retrieval.

## Vector Database (Qdrant)

The core retrieval functionality is powered by **Qdrant**, a high-performance vector search engine.

-   **Technology:** Qdrant
-   **Purpose:** Stores embeddings and metadata for all datasets. Supports:
    -   **Dense Vectors:** 1024-dimensional vectors (generated by `BAAI/bge-m3`) for semantic search.
    -   **Sparse Vectors:** Term-frequency vectors for keyword search (BM25).
    -   **Hybrid Search:** Combines dense and sparse results using Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF).
-   **Location:** Running as a separate service within the Kubernetes cluster. Data is persisted on a Persistent Volume Claim (PVC).
